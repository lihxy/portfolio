        <h2>Intro to Robotics</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Learning about robots gave me an insight on how complex robotics are. Robots doing machine-learning to become smarter makes me
              excited and nervous about the future of robotics. I am scared that robots will take over the world one day.</li>
          <li>Working in groups are good became everyone can work together and pitching in ideas to come up with the best solution. It
              could be better if everyone could work on the same document together to write code because it is confusing to have 4 versions
              of the same idea in code.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Intro to Robotics - Blinking LED's</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>My team worked together by pitching in ideas of the lightshow and agreeing on one. Then, we each separated and did our
              own version of the idea on code. It could of been better if our team had 1 version of the code and everyone pitched in 
              to write the code with testing code on the different laptops.</li>  
          <li>Basic Pieces of Arduino sketch: </li>

              <li><img src="https://s2.postimg.org/xnztyjjo9/Untitled.png"></li>
              <span>The setup function and a function where all the code loops</span>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h2>Intro to Robotics - Dance Party</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>I learned that circuits could be connected to breadboards for testing and not just directly to a power source.
              In addition, I learned that circuits could be attached to an Arduino.</li>
          <li>My favorite part of my robot's dance was when it did little stops while it moved forward. It looked like it was doing a
              popping move.</li>
